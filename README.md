## Uncensored

Are your comments always getting deleted by the owner? In Remark, this is not possbile anymore. Your comments can only be deleted by violating our Terms of Service.

## Better

Replies, Mentions, Upvotes and Downvotes - we have everything you need! Thanks to our voting system, you will always see the most important comments first.

## Anywhere

You could possibly comment anywhere you want! Even on sites that don't have a comment system. And the best of it - you can do all of that with just one account!
